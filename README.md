This is the Quantum Anomalous Hall code in Ultra-thin film of magnetic 
topological insulator:

for the Ferromagnetic-topological (FM-TI) configuration

Here, you will find one text file per book chapter, containing some of 
the source codes in that paper.
  
Almost all the codes in this chapter can be run independently with some 
supporting subprograms genH.m (Generating model Hamiltonian for layered material), 
arrow3D.m  (existing program to generate 3D arrow). All the codes a named 
in consistency with values of magnetization:

### file: Mz**.m

Copy the code Mz**.m into your local directory and launch it with
